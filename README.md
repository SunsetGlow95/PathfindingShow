# PathfindingShow

This is a show of a variety of pathfinding algorithms. Now includes:

- Depth First Search
- Breadth First Search
- A* Search
- Best First Search
- IDDFS
- IDA* Search

And it's going to be showed in class on May 25th.

P.S. The Programs were wrote on MacOS. If you run them in Windows, you'll have to make some change in the `Maze.h`.
